# Stealth-Game-with-AI-Java-LWJGL-
A top down stealth game made in java using the LWJGL library, the intention is to create a stealth game with a guard that uses reinforcement learning to improve over time and challenge the player. The game currently contains a player, a guard, a score counter for both the player and the guard (shown in the console), and a chasing mechanic for the guard.
